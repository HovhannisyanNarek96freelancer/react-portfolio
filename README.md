# Portfolio For Designer
https://curious-flan-f2cac5.netlify.app/

Using React, Sanity, and SASS, I developed a custom landing page portfolio that showcased the client's work in a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate way. I implemented smooth scrolling, dynamic transitions, and interactive animations to enhance the user experience and showcase the client's design skills.

For the server side, I set up a Sanity Studio, which allowed the client to easily add, update, and manage their portfolio data, including images, project descriptions, and links. I ensured that the server was secure, scalable, and easily integratable with the landing page portfolio.
